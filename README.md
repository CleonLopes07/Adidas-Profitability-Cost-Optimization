# 📊 Adidas US Profitability & Cost Optimization Analysis

Tools: Excel · Power BI · Business Analytics
Domain: Retail | Pricing | Cost Optimization | Strategy

🔍 Problem Statement

Adidas operates across multiple retailers, regions, and product categories in the U.S. market. While topline sales may appear strong, profitability varies significantly across products, retailers, and regions due to differences in pricing, cost structures, and sales channels.

The business challenge is to identify where profits are truly generated and lost, and to evaluate pricing and cost optimization strategies that can improve long-term profitability without harming demand.

🎯 Project Objectives

Identify high- and low-performing products, retailers, and regions

Understand true profitability after cost allocation

Evaluate pricing strategies using what-if simulations

Provide data-backed, consulting-style recommendations

Build an executive-ready dashboard for decision-makers

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Excel	Data cleaning, KPI modeling, cost allocation, pricing simulations
Power BI	Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards
DAX	Profitability metrics, scenario analysis, Pareto calculations
📂 Data Overview

The dataset contains 29+ business variables, including:

Sales, units sold, and pricing

Cost components (COGS, marketing, logistics, overhead)

Retailers and sales channels

Product categories and regions

📈 Key Analyses Performed
1. Executive Profitability Overview

Revenue, profit, margin KPIs

Channel performance comparison (Online vs In-Store)

2. Retailer Profitability Deep Dive

High-revenue but low-margin retailers identified

Profit leakage after cost allocation

3. Product & Category Profitability (Pareto Analysis)

~20–30% of products generate ~70–80% of profit

Long tail of low-margin SKUs identified

4. Pricing & What-If Simulation

Elastic vs inelastic products tested

Price increases improve profit for select SKUs

5. Cost Allocation & Scenario Comparison

Impact of logistics and marketing costs analyzed

Scenario comparison of cost optimization strategies

6. Geographic / Regional Performance

Regional growth and margin comparison

Investment prioritization recommendations

💡 Key Business Insights

High revenue ≠ high profitability

Some retailers destroy value after cost allocation

Profit is concentrated in a small subset of products

Selective price increases can materially improve margins

Cost optimization has greater impact than volume growth alone

📌 Strategic Recommendations

Optimize Pricing

Increase prices for inelastic, high-margin products

Retailer Rationalization

Renegotiate or exit consistently unprofitable retailers

Cost Control

Optimize logistics and marketing allocation

Growth Focus

Invest in high-margin regions and categories


🚀 Outcome

This project demonstrates an end-to-end profitability optimization workflow, combining Excel modeling, Power BI analytics, and consulting-style insight generation, suitable for Business Analyst, Strategy, and Consulting roles.
