# Adidas US Profitability & Cost Optimization (Excel + Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Business Analytics case study** focused on profitability optimization for Adidas US sales data.  
The analysis goes beyond revenue reporting and provides a **profitability-first framework** using **Excel modeling** and **Power BI dashboarding**.

The goal is to identify:
- Which retailers generate high revenue but weak profit
- Which product categories drive the majority of profit (Pareto 80/20)
- Which regions/states have the strongest margin performance
- How pricing and cost allocation scenarios affect profit outcomes

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Adidas has strong sales performance in the US, but profitability is inconsistent due to:
- Complex cost structures (logistics, marketing, store operations, channel fees)
- Retailer-level margin variation
- Lack of clear visibility into true profit drivers

Revenue alone is not sufficient for strategic decision-making.

---

## ✅ Objectives
- Build an Excel profitability model (KPI framework + cost allocation)
- Develop a Power BI dashboard with DAX measures
- Perform Pareto analysis on product/category profitability
- Simulate pricing scenarios (what-if analysis)
- Analyze retailer profitability performance
- Identify regional investment opportunities
- Deliver consulting-style recommendations

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** (data cleaning, KPI model, cost allocation)
- **Power BI** (dashboard development, DAX measures, scenario simulation)
- **DAX** (profitability measures, Pareto calculations, what-if modeling)
- **GitHub** (project documentation & portfolio publishing)

## 🔑 Key Insights (High-Level)
- Profitability varies widely across retailers and regions.
- Several high-revenue retailers underperform in profit margin.
- Pareto effect exists: ~20% of products generate most of the total profit.
- Logistics + marketing costs are key profit erosion drivers.
- Pricing simulations show margin improvements are possible through controlled price optimization.

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
- Apply pricing optimization based on product elasticity
- Reduce long-tail SKU complexity
- Renegotiate terms with low-margin retailers
- Improve logistics efficiency and marketing spend allocation
- Prioritize investment in high-margin states and channels
